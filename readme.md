A few friends and I have a shared google doc where everyone records the habits they're trying to establish and puts a weekly indicator of whether they've succeeded this week or not. This script interfaces with the doc and alerts everyone if someone has made a change to their habit set. It also sends a Sunday-reminder for everyone to record their progress. Just a fun small project. Also works pretty well as an overall scheme ...

Starting to use the google drive api can be tedious. If you want to set this up for yourself, drop me a line and I can give some pointers - joseikowsky@gmail.com
