Some friends and I have a shared google doc where everyone records the habits they're trying to establish and puts a weekly indicator of whether they succeeded this week or not. This script interfaces with the doc and alerts everyone if someone has made a change to their habit set. It also sends a sunday reminder for everyone to record their progress. Just a fun small project. Also works pretty well as an overall scheme ...
